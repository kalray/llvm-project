Bugs:
- jumptable.ll/@f: jumptable lowering looks broken. No store generated, all BB code eliminated.

Performance regressions:
- @zeroinit2048: xso ordering is more random, is it impactful?
- jfdctint.ll: more stack used. More spills?
- loadstore-T12917.ll/@f: "call h" got transformed into "ld $r16" + "set $ra" + "add $r12" + "goto", which is slower
- loadc.ll/@loadcbc: extra zxwd in arguments and return values
- maddwq.ll/@maddsumwq_v3: srld immediate pattern was not matched
- vecreduce.ll/@v2_vecreduce_or_cmp_sle_i64: useless compd.ne
